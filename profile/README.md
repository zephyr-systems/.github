## What is Zephyr Systems?

**Zephyr Systems** is an organization dedicated to making autonomous AI agents safer, faster, and more capable through better shell infrastructure.

We're building [Zephyr](https://github.com/zephyr-systems/zephyr)—a security-focused shell environment designed from the ground up for AI agents like Claude Code, Codex Computer Use, and similar AI-driven automation systems—along with a growing ecosystem of modules, tools, and integrations.

### The Problem We're Solving

AI agents today execute shell commands with full user privileges but operate in shell environments designed for humans, not autonomous systems. This creates serious challenges:

- **No safety boundaries** – Agents can accidentally (or maliciously) run destructive commands
- **Hidden capabilities** – Agents can't discover what shell functions are available without trial and error
- **Security blind spots** – No way to scan or validate code before it runs
- **Fragmented tooling** – Every team rebuilds the same utilities from scratch

### Our Solution

Zephyr provides the missing infrastructure layer between AI agents and the shell:

- **🔒 Security by design** – Built-in scanning prevents execution of malicious code
- **📦 Modular ecosystem** – Reusable, composable modules instead of scattered scripts
- **🤖 Agent-first API** – Machine-readable outputs and structured capability discovery
- **⚡ Zero friction** – Fast loading, simple installation, no configuration headaches

---

## The Zephyr Ecosystem

Our organization hosts several repositories that work together to create a complete platform for AI agents:

### 🏗️ Core Infrastructure

#### **[zephyr](https://github.com/zephyr-systems/zephyr)**
The foundation—a fast, secure shell loader that manages modules and enforces security policies.

**What it does:**
- Loads shell modules with dependency awareness
- Scans code for security risks before execution
- Provides JSON APIs for programmatic shell interaction
- Manages module installation from Git repositories

**Start here if you're:** A user wanting to install Zephyr, an AI engineer integrating agents, or a developer wanting to understand the technical architecture.

---

### 📚 Module Ecosystem

#### **[awesome-zephyr-modules](https://github.com/zephyr-systems/awesome-zephyr-modules)** *(coming soon)*
A curated directory of community and official modules, vetted for quality and security.

**What you'll find:**
- Recommended modules organized by category
- Security ratings and compatibility info
- Installation guides and quick examples
- Community module submissions

**Start here if you're:** Looking for existing modules to extend your shell, or wanting to publish your own module to the community.

---

## Quick Start

Get Zephyr running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Install the core loader
git clone https://github.com/zephyr-systems/zephyr.git
cd zephyr && make install

# 2. Add to your shell
echo 'eval "$($HOME/.zsh/bin/zephyr load)"' >> ~/.zshrc

# 3. Start using it
exec zsh
zephyr list
```

## Why Open Source?

We believe the infrastructure that powers AI agents should be:

- **Transparent** – Anyone can audit the security model and scanning logic
- **Community-driven** – Better modules come from diverse perspectives and use cases
- **Freely available** – Critical safety infrastructure shouldn't be behind paywalls
- **Collaborative** – The challenges of agent security are industry-wide

That's why Zephyr and all first-party modules are MIT-licensed and developed in the open.
